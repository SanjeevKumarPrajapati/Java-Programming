<-------------------------------- Introduction of java -------------------------->

1.) Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun_Micro_systems_Inc in the year 1991.
2.) It is simple programming language.
3.) Java makes writing , compliling and dubugging programming easy.
4.) It helps to create reuseable code and modular program.
5.) Java is a class-based , object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies are possible.


<----------------------------------- History of Java--------------------------------->

1.) java is a programming language created in 1991.
2.) James Gosling , Mike Sheriaan and Patrick Naughton , a team of sun Engineers known as the green team initiated the java language in1991.
3.) Sun Microsystems released it's first public implementation in 1996 as java 1.0.
4.) In 1997 , Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standard body and later formalized withdrew from the process.
5.) On November 13,2006 Sun released much of its virtual machine as free (JVM) , open source software.
6.) On may 8 2007 , sun finished the process making all of its JVM's core code available under open-source distribution terms.
7.) The principles for creating java were simple, robust,high performance,portable,Multi-Threading,complier and interpreted based language,
dynamic.. etc.
8.) James Gosling iin 1995 developed java who is known as the Father of java.
9.) Currently java is used in Mobile devices,internet,programming, games, etc.

<---------------------------------------- Java Features ------------------------------------->

1.) Complier and interpreted based language
2.) Plateform Independent
3.) Portable
4.) Object-oriented
5.) Robust
6.) Secure



<------------------------------ Java Program Explanation ---------------------------------->


Class :- The class contain the data and methods to be used in the program.Motheds define the behavior of the class. Class "a" has only one method
	main in java;

static:- static keyword tell us that this method is accessible without instantiating the class;

void() :- keyword tell that this method will not return anything.
main() :- The main method is the entry point of our application.

System.in():- This is the standard input stream that is used to read char.. form the keyboard or key any other input device.

System.out():- This is the standard output stream that is used to produce the result of a program on an output clear like the computer screen.

println() :- This method in java is also used to display text on the console and the curcor moves to the start of the next line at the console.
	The next Printing takes from the next line.
